# NexGen Predictive Delivery Optimizer

Predict delivery delays before they happen and take action early.


## Summary 

This project is a data-driven logistics tool that predicts which deliveries are at risk of being delayed.
It uses machine learning and interactive visual dashboards to help logistics teams make faster, smarter decisions.

Built with Streamlit, it combines multiple CSV datasets (orders, delivery, routes, fleet, and feedback) into one clean analytics app.



## What actually it does

* Merges and cleans logistics data automatically.
* Predicts on-time vs delayed deliveries.
* Shows interactive charts on delivery trends and customer feedback.
* Highlights key factors causing delays (route, priority, carrier, etc.).
* Lets you download predictions and cleaned data.



## Tech Stack

Python, Streamlit, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Plotly
